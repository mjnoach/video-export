// TODO
// Feature: Option to choose export quality?
// Feature: Option to generate captions?
// Feature: Multiple slider ranges for exporting a video combined of multiple clips
// Feature: Add a cropping frame that will only capture the selected area for a given slider range
// Feature: Add watermarks
// Feature: Add Security remarks to the homepage:
//          Your users' data only lives inside their browser, no need to worry about any data leakage or network latency.
// Feature: Show download progress on the client
// Feature: Add feature flag for server exports on local environment


// Fix: Abort export when user leaves the editor
// Fix: Reloading remote source page?

// Rate limiting?
// If source is remote, after download, write it to FFmpeg FS and on subsequent loads check if there's a resouce already for that url

// Improve: Review upload and export file formats
// Improve: Cache ffmpeg to prevent reloading on page refresh
// Improve: Secure api/download action to prevent it from being accessed outside the app

// Optimise: cpu, memory, bandwidth, disk
